# Medi-flash
Medi-Flash allows a user to create flashcards grouped by subject. The user has the option of typing in the definition of a flashcard term or retrieving a definition from the Merriam Webster Medical Dictionary and editing that. Cards can be placed into 2 categories, those that need more studying, the default, and those that have been memorized. This was developed by a team of 3 developers using React and Express. Data is read from the Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary API. The data is in XML format and is converted to JSON using the npm xml2js.
