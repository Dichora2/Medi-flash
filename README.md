# Medi-flash
Medi flash uses Express for the back end and React for the front end. Data is read from the Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary API. The data is in XML format and is converted to JSON using the npm xml2js. Can not figure out why it sometimes returns from a promise as successful but it doesn't actually get the data from the database.
